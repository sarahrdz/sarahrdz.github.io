    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        During my time at the University of Oklahoma, I have been apart of the Pride of Oklahoma as an alto saxophone player and Kappa Kappa Psi, an honorary band service fraternity.
        I have spent the last four years playing and serving the Pride. I love being apart of the largest student organization on campus, I truly found my family through these organizations.
