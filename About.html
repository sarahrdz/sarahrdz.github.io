        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            During my time at the University of Oklahoma, I have been apart of the Pride of Oklahoma as an alto saxophone player and a brother of Kappa Kappa Psi, an honorary band service fraternity.
            I have spent the last four years playing and serving the Pride. I have loved being apart of the largest student organization on campus, I truly found my family through these organizations.

        <p>
            I have enjoyed my time at the University of Oklahoma and I am excited to see what the future holds for me. I have learned so much about myself and what I am capable of.
            I have learned that I enjoy working with data and new technologies. I am excited to see where my career takes me and I am excited to see what I can do with my skills.
