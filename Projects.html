                <p class="card-text">For this project my group and I created a database from the ground up. We started with the conceptual design by getting all the essential data from the client. We then created an ERD based of what is needed from the client. For the logical design we normalized all the data. Then we moved into physical design and implementation by using MySQL Server. Overall, I had a great experience getting creating a database with my group!</p>
